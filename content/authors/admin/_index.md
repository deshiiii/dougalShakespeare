      - Thesis: "Multi-affordance Concentration Dynamics on Music Streaming Platforms."
      - Description: Through a large-scale statistical analysis of Deezer users' consumption histories and expressed off-platform attitudes my thesis examines how music streaming platforms facilitate attentive or passive music interactions and furthermore, the role of algorithmic devices in creating confined or rather, diverse listening practices.

## About Me

I am a Computational Social Science researcher specializing in Music Information Retrieval, algorithmic confinement and cultural evolution. My research interests revolve around understanding how modern day music streaming platforms and the algorithmic devices they contain shape cultural consumption practices both on and off platform.

Until recently, I was based at the Centre Marc Bloch's [Computational Social Science Team](https://cmb.huma-num.fr/css-seminar/) in Berlin.
