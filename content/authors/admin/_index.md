## About Me

I am a mixed methods UX researcher with a specialization in user research focused on **music** and **video games**. I have collaborated with partners such as **Deezer** and **EA**, delivering actionable insights in two domains I am deeply passionate about. I am currently finalising a **PhD** in Computational Social Science, in which I examine how **music streaming platforms** and their underlying algorithmic systems shape cultural consumption—both on and off platform—through the analysis of granular user listening histories from Deezer.


Until recently, I was based at the Centre Marc Bloch's [Computational Social Science Team](https://cmb.huma-num.fr/css-seminar/) in Berlin where I undertook my PhD in collaboration with Deezer.
